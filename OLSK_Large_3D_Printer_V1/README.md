Introduction
--

OLSK Large 3D Printer is a big format 3D Printer with large printing volume of 1000 x 1000 x 1000 mm, making it the largest open source 3D printer. It features a large volume hot-end of a 1.4 mm single nozzle, Titan Aero extruder with CNC milled copper heating block (80W heater) and 4 x 700W AC bed heaters with solid state relay, resulting in faster prints. This machine can print with max speed of 200 mm/s and it is also equipped with inductive sensors for homing, auto calibration of the bed and touch screen. Its design innovates by using bended parts which can be replicable in Fab Labs, such as the housing panels. The converter board and the heating block are custom made, joining in the whole design fabricated parts with standard components.

The Assembly Workbook
--

All OLSK machines are open source and have the BOM and necessary files available in this repository for replication. The assembly of parts is also documented in a workbook where each step contains a list of parts, tools and instruction remarks, following a logic order to provide a smooth assembly.
